Flutter game

Finding Red is a Project on Flutter made by myself.

In this directory you will find Finding_red.zip it contains all the files required to run the game.
The file contains three files assets,lib and pubspec. To run the project first run 
flutter create Finding_Red on your terminal. It will create a basic flutter app .
Enter the file and delete the test file , we wont be using that .
copy the contents of the zip file into the Finding_Red file.
Check all the dependencies. Connect your phone with USB debugging on and run the command
flutter run on your terminal. This will create an apk file and run the app on your device.

There is a login required to play the game. The database is inside the code so there are three 
usernames and password. You can change the later if desired. So login with username user1 and password as password1. You will be directed to a main menu screen. On pressing the buttion with 
play icon on it the game will start. You traverse through the level going through the checkpoint
,avoiding the saw blades and collecting fruits to add on the score. There are currently 4 stages
and more will be added on later updates.
